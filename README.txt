  What is this?
  -------------

  Timeplot is a cross-browser DHTML (canvas-based) time series plotting widget.



  Running Timeplot
  ----------------

  Timeplot consists of a bunch of static resources. All you really need is to
  serve those resources off a web server. Any web server would do.
  
  But if you don't have any available to you, we have configured the timeplot
  project to be runnable Jetty, so if you have a java virtual machine 
  installed you can open a shell or command prompt and type:
  
   [win32]> run
   [unix/macosx]> ./run

  and then point your browser to
  
   http://127.0.0.1:9999/timeplot/
  


  How do I customize Timeplot?
  ----------------------------

  Refer to the Timeplot web site at

  Licensing and legal issues
  --------------------------

  Timeplot is open source software and are licensed under the BSD license
  located in the LICENSE.txt file located in the same directory as this 
  very file you are reading.

  Timeplot depends on and ships with the Explorer Canvas javascript library 
  that is released under the Apache License 2.0 and can be found at
